# Booktoki Scraper
Use at your own risk, educational purposes only.

The page will ban your ip if interval or the number of requests are too high.

Timing can be modified in the main function.

Any userscript manager should work fine, I used [violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/).

Start on chapter x, it will automatically save the content to file, then move onto the next chapter after a slight delay.

File download location can be set in the browser.

Feel free to modify, I don't read novels.

Bye
